**NEXT STEPS**

*Game Play* 
- need an automatic sequence where the game generates a pattern of colors

- pattern needs to load into an array

- need a function that loads player clicks into an array

- need a function that compares the player array to the game array, if matching, reset game and click up to next level

*Changes/Fixes*
- change color changes in js to classes and set up toggle on click

- fix window sizing, consider mobile view options?
